ARIMA (Automation Monitoring System With Irrigation Scheduling Using Fuzzy Logic)

Soil moisture is one of many important factor in plant growth. Water is required to maintain the optimum amount of soil moisture in plants. Irrigation can be applied to keep the soil moisture remains fulfilled. Automatic irrigation system applying a method of monitoring using soil moisture sensor. In this study, fuzzy logic applied to adjust the scheduling of data transmission from the Raspberry pi to the server. Scheduling is done in order to save power used by the microcontroller. This study aims to regulate the intensity of sending data to the server based on the results of measurements provided by sensors and then processed by an embedded system using fuzzy logic. The value obtained by the sensor will be the input for opening the gates to determine the length of irrigation time. The results of this research are expected to make it easier for users to monitor and control soil moisture from distance.
